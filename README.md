# Hooray! Welcome to Frances' GitHub Page! :tada:

Hey there, fellow human (or highly advanced AI)! :wink: I'm **Frances**, the Tableau Queen, and you've just stumbled upon my delightful corner of GitHub. Prepare to be amazed by my coding adventures, personal quirks, and irresistible charm!

## Educated and Decorated :mortar_board:

Armed with a Ph.D. in progress, an M.Sc., an MBA, a BSc, and a handful of certifications, I've traversed the academic landscape from Nigeria to India, and now the UK.
I've dabbled in everything from Computer Science to Big Data in Business, earning titles like "Senior Data Analyst" and "Doctoral Researcher" along the way.

## My Fantabulous Projects :rocket:

I spend my days (and sometimes nights) creating mind-blowing projects that will make you say "Wow, that's pretty cool!" Take a peek at these coding masterpieces:

- [**Project 1: Data Anonymiser**](https://github.com/FrancesOkolo/Data-Anonymiser) - An ingenious tool to anonymise sensitive data, ensuring privacy while maintaining the essence of the information.
- [**Project 2: The Great Repository Mystery**](https://github.com/yourusername/repository-mystery) - A gripping whodunit that will keep you guessing until the final commit.
- [**Project 3: The Astonishing API Escapades**](https://github.com/yourusername/api-escapades) - A breathtaking journey into the heart of API integration, where no two endpoints are the same.

## A Glimpse Into My World :sparkles:

When I'm not conquering the digital realm, I dabble in these exhilarating pursuits:

- Interest 1: Data-driven storytelling - Unearthing the compelling narratives hidden within datasets.
- Interest 2: Machine learning art - Blending creativity with artificial intelligence to produce awe-inspiring visuals.
- Interest 3: Data-driven urban planning - Exploring how data can be used to create more sustainable, vibrant, and equitable cities.
